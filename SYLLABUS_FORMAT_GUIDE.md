# Syllabus Data Format Guide

## üìö **How to Provide Syllabus Information**

There are several ways you can provide the NCERT syllabus data to integrate into Kalika:

## üéØ **Method 1: JSON Upload (Recommended)**

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
Create a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "class": "10th Grade (SSLC)",
  "subjects": [
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "chapters": [
        {
          "number": 1,
          "name": "Real Numbers",
          "topics": [
            "Euclid's Division Lemma",
            "Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic", 
            "Irrational Numbers",
            "Decimal Expansions"
          ],
          "learning_objectives": [
            "Understand the real number system",
            "Apply Euclid's division algorithm",
            "Prove irrationality of numbers",
            "Understand decimal expansions"
          ],
          "duration_hours": 12
        },
        {
          "number": 2,
          "name": "Polynomials",
          "topics": [
            "Zeroes of Polynomials",
            "Division Algorithm",
            "Geometric Meaning of Zeroes",
            "Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients"
          ],
          "learning_objectives": [
            "Find zeroes of polynomials",
            "Understand polynomial division",
            "Graph polynomials",
            "Understand zero-coefficient relationships"
          ],
          "duration_hours": 15
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Science",
      "chapters": [
        {
          "number": 1,
          "name": "Chemical Reactions and Equations",
          "topics": [
            "Chemical Equations",
            "Balancing Chemical Equations",
            "Types of Chemical Reactions",
            "Oxidation and Reduction"
          ],
          "learning_objectives": [
            "Write and balance chemical equations",
            "Identify different types of reactions",
            "Understand redox reactions",
            "Apply conservation of mass"
          ],
          "duration_hours": 10
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Upload via Admin Interface
1. Go to `/admin/syllabus` in your application
2. Paste the JSON data
3. Click "Preview" to validate
4. Click "Upload Syllabus"

## üìã **Method 2: Manual Entry**

### For Each Subject, Provide:
- **Subject Name** (e.g., "Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry")
- **Chapter List** with:
  - Chapter number
  - Chapter name
  - Topics covered
  - Learning objectives
  - Estimated duration

### Example Format:
```
Subject: Mathematics (10th Grade)

Chapter 1: Real Numbers
Topics: Euclid's Division Lemma, Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, Irrational Numbers
Objectives: Understand real number system, Apply division algorithm
Duration: 12 hours

Chapter 2: Polynomials  
Topics: Zeroes of Polynomials, Division Algorithm, Geometric Meaning
Objectives: Find zeroes, Understand division, Graph polynomials
Duration: 15 hours
```

## üìñ **Method 3: NCERT Textbook Reference**

### Provide Textbook Information:
- **Class**: 10th/11th/12th
- **Subject**: Name of subject
- **Textbook Chapters**: List of chapters from NCERT textbook
- **Topics per Chapter**: Main topics covered
- **Learning Outcomes**: What students should learn

## üéØ **Method 4: Spreadsheet Format**

### Create an Excel/CSV with columns:
| Class | Subject | Chapter_Number | Chapter_Name | Topics | Learning_Objectives | Duration_Hours |
|-------|---------|----------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 10th Grade | Mathematics | 1 | Real Numbers | Euclid's Division Lemma; Fundamental Theorem | Understand real numbers; Apply algorithm | 12 |
| 10th Grade | Mathematics | 2 | Polynomials | Zeroes; Division Algorithm | Find zeroes; Graph polynomials | 15 |
